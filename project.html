                <p>As observed in the introduction, the rate of alcohol and substance abuse in quite high. Thus, substance abuse rehabilitation centres have been established to help volatile substance users regain their status and social position in the society.

                    However, as these centres continue to work, it is evident that they leave out important steps that are critical in offering complete therapy for the alcohol and drug abusers. Research ascertains the importance of groups in rehabilitative counselling and the administration of recovery medications for drug and alcohol abuse addicts (O’Farrell & Fals-Stewart, 2008).
                    
                    Borrowing from this, it can be argued that drug and alcohol abuse is a habit that occurs in the social space. According to Morgenstern and Longabaugh (2000), the cognitive behaviours of individuals who engage in drug and substance abuse are largely shaped by the environment in which they dwell.</p>
